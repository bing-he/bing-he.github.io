__1. Detecting slow slip event from seafloor pressure data using machine learning__ ([here](https://github.com/bing-he/SSE_detection_using_machine_learning) for code and details)

A slow slip event is a special tectonic signal with strong energy compared to a Magnitude of 6 earthquakes but releases energy gently that people can not feel. The signal represents the release of tectonic stress between earthquakes, and thus, their existence indicates a lower likelihood of future large earthquakes and tsunamis. However, it is challenging to detect such signals because standard measuring instruments do not work underwater, and considerable ocean noise makes the detection hard. I trained a machine learning model, which can quickly and accurately detect the signals in long-time data.
