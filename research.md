__1. Detecting slow slip event from seafloor pressure data using machine learning__ ([here](https://github.com/bing-he/SSE_detection_using_machine_learning) for code and details)

Slow slip event is a special tectonic signal with strong energy compared to a Magnitude of 6 earthquakes but releases energy gently that people can not feel. This signal represents the release of tectonic stress between earthquakes, and thus, their existence indicates a lower likelihood of future large earthquakes and tsunamis. However, it is challenging to detect such signals because standard measuring instruments do not work underwater, and considerable ocean noise makes the detection hard. This work trained a machine learning model, which can quickly and accurately detect the signals in continuous data.

__3. (Cooperation work) Separation of seismic signal using machine learning methods__ ([here](https://github.com/yinjiuxun/WaveDecompNet) for code and details)

A seismogram is a record of how the ground moves and usually contains a rich mix of different seismic signals. The transient signals capture the seismic process and it is essential to understand its mechanism. The ambient noise field is useful in correlation seismology to extract spatial and temporal variations in the Earth structur. This work developed a multi-task encoder-decoder network named WaveDecompNet to separate transient signals from ambient signals directly.
