I like traveling, cooking, and playing with 'Sushi' (cat) during spare time. Here shows a few photos of my life.

## Traveling
My husband and I recently drove our 'little red fat' from Boston to Los Angeles, 8-days, 3250 miles. The journey is tiring but rewarding. We saw many beautiful views and experienced many fun and cool stuffs. They are precious memories I will never forget. We are expecting the next road trip!
